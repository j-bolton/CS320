# CS 320: Software Test Automation & QA
# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
When writing code, it is important to make sure that it delivers the functionality that is needed from it, as this is the ultimate purpose of the code to begin with. Successfully translating software requirements documentation into working code is a skill that takes time to develop but that will be invaluable to me as a developer. Ensuring security is also of great importance in development as this can deter or prevent unwanted use of the system. 
# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Collecting and reviewing information about what needs the system or program is being designed to meet is a critical step that occurs early on in the software development lifecycle. Translating this information into working code is a skill that requires experience with various programming languages and APIs, and is something that I am continuing to practice.
# How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software as a problem that must be solved. By analyzing each facet of the problem, or problems, complete solutions can be developed. In larger projects, by tackling each problem individually, building the project incrementally, and thoroughly testing my work, I can be sure that each requirement is met.
